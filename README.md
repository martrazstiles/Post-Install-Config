Awesome! With osTicket installed successfully, it's time to carry out administrative configuration tasks. We'll begin by setting up user roles to help manage permissions and access across the platform.

To define roles in osTicket, head to the Admin Panel, navigate to Agents, then choose Roles. Click "Add new role" and input a name like "Supreme Admin". This role will include full system access, so make sure to enable every available permission before saving.

Next, select "Departments" under the Agents section. Youâ€™ll use this area to assign agents to specific departments. Create one called "System Administrators" to house all Supreme Admin-level users. Additional features like SLA policies, department managers, and email settings can be configured here to fine-tune your support workflow.
